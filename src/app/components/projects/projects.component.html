            This website was created for a friend of mine's dog grooming
            business. We decided to focus on mobile-first design, as most of her
            clients reach her on mobile devices as opposed to desktop. Bootstrap
            was used to keep the design responsive.

            A Wordle clone I made using Jquery. The game also features a fun
            confetti animation when the user wins, which was made using
            Matter.js.

            This website was a group project for my Data Visualization course.
            The pattern library was created first, then the data dashboard using
            the D3.js library. I contributed the color and typography section
            for the pattern library, and 4 charts for the data dashboard.
