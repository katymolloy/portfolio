<h1>more about me</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Katy Molloy, and I'm a
  passionate and creative web developer dedicated to crafting user-friendly and
  visually appealing websites. With a strong foundation in front-end and
  back-end technologies, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and a keen
  eye for design to every project. What started as copying and pasting HTML code
  to customize my Tumblr blog has become a deep interest in coding and web
  technologies. Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  and various web development frameworks to build responsive and dynamic
  websites. I thrive on challenges and believe in continuous learning to stay at
  the forefront of the ever-evolving web development landscape. Whether it's
  creating interactive user interfaces, optimizing website performance, or
  solving complex coding puzzles, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a
  commitment to delivering high-quality solutions. In addition to my technical
  expertise, I understand the importance of collaboration and effective
  communication in the development process. I enjoy working closely with clients
  to transform their ideas into reality and take pride in delivering projects
  that exceed expectations. Explore my portfolio to witness the culmination of
  my dedication and skills in the world of web development.
