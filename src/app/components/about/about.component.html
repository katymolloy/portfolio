        My name is Katy, and I'm a full-stack web developer based out of
        Ontario, Canada.

        With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I bring
        a unique blend of technical skills and a keen eye for design to every
        project.

        My first introduction to web development was customzing my Tumblr blog
        in the ninth grade. I remember being so amazed at how code managed to
        change the look of my blog. Ever since then I have had a strong
        appreciation for fun, interactive, and unique web design.

        Whether it's creating interactive user interfaces, optimizing website
        performance, or solving complex coding puzzles, I approach each task
        with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.
        In addition to my technical expertise, I understand the importance of
        collaboration and effective communication in the development process. I
        enjoy working closely with clients to transform their ideas into reality
        and take pride in delivering projects that exceed expectations.
